		<b><p>CAREER OBJECTIVE</p></b>
		<p>My aspiration is to become a Software Developer.</p><br>

		<b><p>EXPERIENCE</p></b>
		<p>
			On Labour Days I go to the Golden Age Home and help with laundry-folding, storing clothes in designated areas and perform other given tasks.<br><br>In Summer 2021 I worked at Maxie Department Store from August 9 to August 27. Job title: Customer Service Representative. This job comprised of greeting people and guiding them to areas of their choice, repricing and restocking assests. It also entailed assisting the chashiers by removing sensors from items and placing them in shopping bags. In cases where the security was on lunch, I would stand at the bag counter at the door and sanitize individuals as they entered.<br><br>In Summer 2019 I went to Sunrise Early Childhood Developmnt Centre to do community service. I helped each student with their work for the summer school programme and helped clean and redecorate the classrooms for the new school year that was to come.<br><br>
