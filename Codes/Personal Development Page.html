			The book "Twelve Pillars" is one which encourages one to make a change in their life for the better.<br><br> Chapter four is entitiled "Achieve Your 	Goals". This chapter encourages one to set goals and make an effort to achieve them. I understood that one cannot not change their course of life overninght, but can change their direction. For example, one cannot be working at a low-paying job and overnight start their big career. However, they can change the way in which they have been doing things in order to get to where they want to be. This chapter highlights the importance of writing down the goals taht one wants to achieve so that the mind becomes conciously aware of them and subsequently work hard to achive them. There was mention of long range goals, mid-range goals, short range goals and micro-goals. The range of goal is not what matters, it is the fact that the goals that hae been set are achieved.<br><br> Chater five is entitiled "The Proper Use of Time". This chapter highlights the importance of spending days wisely. According to the book, one knows they have spent their day wisely when they spend the day doing things that leads them to their goals. It is one of two thigs, either one runs the day, or the day runs them. We should strive for the former because that is how one knows that they are disciplined and is spending their day wisely.<br><br> Chapter 6 is entitled "Surround Yourself With the Best People". Chapter six mentions the importance of surrounding ourselve with the people because the people we surround ourselves with, have an impact in the way we behave and how successful we become in life. We should surround ourselves with successful people who will encourage us to reach after the things that will make us grow and fulfill our destiny. We should take the time to look at our relationships-whether romantic or platonic, and see whether or not they are holding us back to unlocking our full potential and make adjustments if necessary. The chapter also let us know that we attract what we become-if we are successful people, we will attract successful people. Lastly, one's attitude is shaped by association. This means that the people that we surround and interact ourselves with, determine what our attitude is like.<br><br> In Chapter seven of the book "Twelve Pillars", the highlight is that, successful people are life-long learners. The chapter went on to say that formal education is good, but it is one who indulges in self-education that becomes even more successful. There are various ways in which one can self-educate themself. This includes: reading books, learning from susccessful people by observation and to reflect on your own experiences and see where you went wrong and adjust accordingly. Reading books is important, as one can acquire so much new knowledge and wisdom. Furthermore, reading books allow us to get a glimpse of the minds of successful peole and consequently gives us the will to become successful too.<br><br> I can and will apply all of this information that I have learnt to my life. I will ensure that I write down my goals, whether short-term, long term, mid-term or micr-term and try my best to work hard so that I can achive them. In addition, I will tey to spend my time wisely and discipline myself to stick to schedules that I have created. I will be more concious of the fact that the day can run me and so I will choose to run the day and accomplish my tasks daily with diligence. Furthermore, I will surround myself with people who will encourage me to reach for the stars and encourage me to be my best self. I will look into my life and analyze my relationships to see if any adjustment is necessary so that I can rid myself of people who impacts me negatively. Lastly, I understand that formal eduction is good, but I need to go further to self-educate myself as this is how I will become moresuccessful than the average person who justs graduate college and stop there. As a result, I will try to read meaningful books so I can gain more than a handful of knowledge and apply them to my life. In the same way, I will make an effort to learn from susccessful people by observing their behaviour and actions and follow. Lastly, I will intentionally reflect on my own life experiences and analyze where I went wrong and adjust where necessary.<br><br>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
